Discussion of starvation: The overall conclusion is there can be starvation. Inside each lane, the first arrived car will try to acquire the intersection locks it requires and cross the intersection first (although this sequence is the reverse of the ordering these cars appear in schedule.txt), but there is no guarantee that a car that arrives early in one lane will acquire the lock earlier than a car that arrives late in another lane (assume these two cars need a same lock to cross the intersection). In fact, when a lock is available, all the cars in the front of each lane (head of the buffer) have an equal chance of acquiring it, therefore there might be starvation if a car in the front of a certain lane is very unlucky and keeps being beaten by the cars in the front of other lanes and even their followers. Of course, this problem can be solved if we introduce the idea of priority, that is: the longer a car in the front of a lane waits, the higher priority it acquires over other cars in the front of their corresponding lanes.
